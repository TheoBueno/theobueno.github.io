  <p>Hello and â€œBoa Noite. <br>
    <br>
    My name is Theo Bueno, I'm a Brazilian living in New York City, with my beautiful wife and our two dogs. <br>
    <br><br>
    I enjoy hiking & climbing, <b>bouldering specially</b> for it's puzzle solving structure: <br> Board Games & Video Games, but above all, <b><i>TableTop RolePlayingGames</i></b>, which give you such a complete sandbox to create tools and solutions to problems that not even the developers had considered.<br>
    <br>
    I love to travel and my passion is cooking new foods from different places. In a way it gives you an insight into other cultures through the ingredients they use, the techniques they apply... that is hard to come by any other way.<br>
    <br><br><br>
    I've always been a <i><b>Tech Savvy guy</i></b> and a rather quick study. <br> I taught myself how to use multiple professional softwares, such as Xactimate, Opera and <i><b>Photoshop</i></b>, through a mixture of exploration and internet research. <br>
    <br> Taking the next step into programming felt like a natural progression.<br>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    A fun fact about myself ---- is that my wife and I have an award winning love story. <br> 
    <br>
    <i>*heh*</i> that's our inside joke.
    <br><br>
    You see, we submitted our story for a competition run by the Joffrey Ballet and ended up winning an incredible evening out that included an amazing Mediterranean dinner with wine pairings and a pair of prime <i><b>orchestra</b></i> seats to the Romeo and Juliet ballet.
