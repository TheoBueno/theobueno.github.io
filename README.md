# Read more about ME!

To use this page you just scroll down through it. I found an interesting picture online from a free image resource website, broke it down using photoshop into layers that one would see if walking up or down a hill looking that way and learned about parallax's and how to apply them.

Using a Parallax as a "Hero" is an interesting visual opening for a page, I then decided to provide the user with the options to either go directly to the coding exercises I did or to a Bio section.
