# HELLO!

## So What's Going on?

Welcome. This is an introduction to my experience learning code! 
Personally, Coding has been both a rolercoaster and puzzle, I's got a 'ups and downs' of a coaster, but it's also a slow burn with huge epiphany moments!

I enjoy thinking of it as my 'Eureka!' moments.

## So how should I get started?

To use this page you just scroll down through it. This is what's called a Parallax, a 2.5D visual experience, where you get the slight experience of shifting depths. As it moves you will notice the appearance of more information and functions, ending in a logo I put together a the foot of the page.

If a user is unintrested in that or knows where they are going, a link is provided uptop to the right to move on.

## And what's the proccess like?

I found an interesting picture online from a free image resource website, broke it down using photoshop into layers that one would see if walking up or down a hill looking that way and learned about parallax's and how to apply them. A mixture of JS, CSS and HTML.

## What did you have in mind?

Using a Parallax as a "Hero" is an interesting visual opening for a page, so I wanted to make use of that visual to show a more modern approach to web design. I then decided to provide the user with a branching pathway, therefore the options to either go directly to the coding exercises I did or to a Bio section.

I also enjoyed making a small visual effect of the "Find out More" opening line to be coming out of the fog from the mountains
