The Begining is Here! Learning Code is my new life.

So far it's been an honest to god roller coaster!

Personally I've felt strongly that there is no better comparisons for coding than puzzling.

It jumps from a static project, even a bit boring, to incredibly exciting in just a moment, and finding a mistake and correcting it feels like the seratonin boost from fitting the right piece in place on a very hard jigsaw puzzle, it can be monotonous or exciting, depending on a number o variables, and hours will pass by and you won't notice the time as much as you should. 

Everything takes longer than you expect it will just by looking at it, and sometimes you use the cover from the box to help, which can be a bit of a cheat, but is in no way against the rules, and actually it's often expected (the box in this case being the entire internet, of course).

So Hello, oh World of Coding.

And let me welcome you to what I hope will be but the first of many epiphanies.

My very own... EUREKAS!
